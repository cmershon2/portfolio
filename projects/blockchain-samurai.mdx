Blockchain Samurai was a bit of a passion project for my friend/business partner, [Johnny Staley](https://johnnystaley.com/), and I. This was a CNFT project based on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. Blockchain Samurai was a lore-heavy, feudal Japan themed CNFT.

While I have not been invested into crypto currency, or particularly interested in it up to this point, this project sounded like a fun way to create art that others may enjoy and it helped that crypto was taking off at the time. Additionally, I was very interested in the technical side of building a product from scratch and creating a community around it. 

Between Johnny and I, we both wore many different hats while working on this project. While we both split the creative portions of the project, such as lore & artwork, Johnny focused on the business, vision, and direction of the project while I focused on the community and technical side. This was a rather large project for me at the time with development being around 5 months and without much knowledge of deploying/distributing large applications.

## The Vision
![The Vision](/projects/bcs/region1.jpg)
> Blockchain Samurai is a CNFT project that encourages community interaction in the Japanese-style fantasy world of Hachi-Sho, Land of the Eight Provinces. Throughout the lifetime of the project, Blockchain Samurai plans to release 10 seasons, with each season containing 10 Chapter releases. As releases progress, samurai clans will be able to influence the lore and develop a community-driven narrative that will shape future chapters.

Blockchain Samurai aimed to develop an interactive, samurai-themed world that is strife with conflict and rich with lore. With the release of each chapter we will build this world together, with our community, for the sake of Hachi-Sho.

## The Architecture
![Architecture](/projects/bcs/architecture.png)
Now that we understand the premise of the project, lets dive into the architecture I designed for it.
### Deployment Environment
- Deployed on a Digital Ocean Kubernetes cluster
- I used containerization for consistent deployment across environments
### Core Services
The application consisted of four main services:
1. Frontend: User interface for the interactive platform
2. Core API: Backend service handling business logic and blockchain interactions
3. Ghost Blog: Content management system for project updates and announcements
4. Discord Bot: Community engagement tool for real-time interactions
### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions were used for automated building of Docker containers
- Streamlined deployment process to the Kubernetes cluster
- Rolling updates were used to ensure minimal downtime within the cluster
### Load Balancing
- Implemented a network load balancer to distribute traffic across services
- Ensured consistent performance for thousands of daily visitors
### Scalability
- Kubernetes orchestration allowed for easy scaling of individual services as needed. Both horizontal and vertical scaling was implemented.
- Containerized architecture provided flexibility for future expansions and updates

This architecture allowed us to scale up/down for fluctuating traffic and API calls while maintaining decent performance.

## Frontend
The frontend of Blockchain Samurai was crafted with attention to detail, combining custom design with efficient web technologies:
### Technologies Used
- HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
- Bootstrap framework for responsive design
### Design Process

- Node-cache: For implementing caching to optimize performance
### Authentication and Authorization
- OAuth2 integration with Discord:
    - Allowed seamless login for users
    - Planned future integration with Discord Bot for enhanced community features
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    - Implemented to manage user permissions efficiently
    - Enabled admin users to manage the community effectively
    - Restricted access to sensitive API resources based on user roles
### Key Features
#### Event Voting System
- Allowed users to participate in shaping the world of Hachi-Sho
- Endpoints for creating, managing, and tallying votes on world events
#### Content Management
- Admin-specific endpoints for:
    - Creating and managing samurai characters
    - Establishing and updating clans
