During my summer internship for the College of Technology, I embarked on an exciting journey to create a precision hand tracker for virtual reality environments. This project aligned with the next steps for the IT3D project to make VR interactions more immersive for students. The objective was to design a controller that could accurately track analog hand movements and convert them into a digital representation within the Unity 3D engine. This project aimed to enhance the interactivity of VR environments by enabling users to interact with 3D models through precise hand movements.
## Purpose
The primary goal was to develop a hand controller equipped with multiple potentiometers to track finger movements. These movements were sent through a microcontroller, which converted the analog signals into digital data. This digital data was then processed by a computer and transposed onto a 3D hand model in Unity 3D. To improve efficiency, custom circuit boards were designed to handle the analog-to-digital conversion more effectively, utilizing multiplexing to reduce latency and allow for future scalability.
## Research Objectives
1. **Defining the Project Scope:**
    - Outlining the project scope and determining achievable goals within the summer months.
    - Planning and sourcing the necessary components for the hand controller.
2. **Developing 3D Models:**
    - Utilizing Blender 2.8 to create 3D models for the hand controller components.
    - Designing joint levers for tracking individual finger joints and creating the mounting plate and microcontroller casing.
3. **Creating the 3D Environment:**
    - Developing a 3D environment in Unity 3D that the hand controller could interact with.
    - Rigging and UV unwrapping a 3D hand model to be controlled by finger placements.
    - Implementing Unity’s HDRP render pipeline for realistic lighting and reflections.
4. **Assembling the Hand Controller:**
    - Soldering and assembling the final product, attaching all components to a glove.
    - Establishing the link between the microcontroller and Unity 3D to track and display finger movements on the 3D hand model.
## Highlights
