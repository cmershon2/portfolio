During my college internship, I had the exciting opportunity to develop a groundbreaking Virtual Reality (VR) application named IT3D that revolutionizes how students learn to build computers. This project combines cutting-edge technology with practical, hands-on learning experiences, making complex technical skills accessible to diverse student populations.
## Project Highlights:
![IT3D Overview](/projects/it-3d/it-3d-group.png)
- **Immersive Learning:** Students step into a virtual world where they can assemble computers piece by piece, gaining practical experience without the risks or costs associated with physical hardware.
- **Wide Accessibility:** Deployed on both Apple App Store and Google Play Store, ensuring broad reach across different devices and platforms.
- **Real-World Impact:** Successfully implemented in the following semester's curriculum, providing students with innovative learning tools.

## Technologies Used:
C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Unity 3D, Blender

## The Vision
In an era where remote learning is becoming increasingly prevalent, our team recognized the need for hands-on experiences that could be delivered virtually. This VR app aims to create a Cyber-Human System that integrates cutting-edge learning modules in information technology, bringing the computer lab directly to students, wherever they may be.

## Key Features:
- **Realistic VR Environment:** Meticulously designed virtual workspace that mimics a real computer building scenario.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Interactive tutorials that lead students through the process of assembling a computer.
- **Component Recognition:** Learn to identify and understand the function of various computer parts.
- **Error Simulation:** Experience common pitfalls and learn troubleshooting techniques in a risk-free environment.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor learning progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Impact and Future Potential
This project represents a significant step forward in STEM education, particularly for diverse or remote student populations. By leveraging affordable VR technology, we're able to provide high-quality, hands-on learning experiences that were previously inaccessible to many.
The successful implementation of this app in the college curriculum demonstrates its effectiveness and potential for wider adoption. As we continue to gather data and feedback, we're excited about the possibilities of expanding this approach to other technical subjects, further bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## Pubulication & Presentations
Our findings and research found during this study were overseen by Dr. Jared Wuerzburger who is an extraordinary human being. He helped mentor me during this crucial time in my life and helped guide me in the development of this project. After the study had been completed, he published the following research paper documenting the findings:

### Presentations
**MWERA Conference**
- Upon completing IT3D, we had the opportunity to present the application at the Mid-Western Educational Research Association Conference in Ohio. This was a new experience to me to be able to present this work to over 150 people and network with professors & fellow research students in the VR space.

**SURE Conference**
- During the Science Undergrad Research Experience conference, we had the opportunity to allow people to use the IT3D app. We had multiple stations setup with VR headsets for attendees to experience the application. Additionally, a smaller presentation was given to a panel of judges.

## Conclusion
Developing IT3D was a transformative experience that allowed me to combine my passion for technology with the goal of improving education. 
It stands as a testament to the power of innovative thinking in solving real-world challenges and opens up new avenues for immersive, engaging learning experiences in the digital age.
